# Enigma-Machine
This is a Java implementation of the Enigma machine. 

The Enigma machine is a cipher device that was used by Nazi Germany during World War II,
in all branches of the German military.

The physical Enigma has an electromechanical rotor mechanism that scrambles the 26 letters in the alphabets.
By using several rotors in series, coupled with the regular stepping movement of the rotors, the Enigma implements
a poly-alphabetic substitution cipher due to ever-changing electrical connections
between the keys and the lights with each keypress. 

## Enigma M3
The Enigma M3 is a 3-rotor electromechanical cipher machine. It was compatible with the Enigma I used by the 
Army (Heer) and Air Force (Luftwaffe).

The M3 was supplied with five cipher rotors that were wired identically to those in the Enigma I. 
This helped to facilitate seamless exchange of messages with the Heer and Luftwaffe. In 1939, three more wheels
(VI, VII, VIII) were added and they were used exclusively by the German Navy (Kriegsmarine).


## Enigma M4
The Enigma M4 was a further development of the M3. It was used exclusively by the U-boat divison of the German
Navy (Kriegsmarine) and was introduced unexpectedly on 2 February 1942.

Besides having 3 more rotors to choose from (VI, VII, VIII), an extra wheel was added to the M4. However, this
extra wheel does not rotate at each keypress. This extra wheel comes in 2 different versions: *Beta* and *Gamma*.

To make space for this one extra wheel, a thinner reflector must be used. This, too, came in 2 different variants:
*B_Thin* and *C_Thin*.
